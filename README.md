# DietLog
REST API and simple view for logging my diet in my private purpose.

### I used ...
DB : MySQL (Using PlanetScale DB Server)
REST API Server using Spring Boot(Java)
view page with html and javascipt

#### next thing to do
1. looking for free WAS server like heroku (damn I realized it get rid of the free plan during this project!)
2. upgrade the view fancier.
